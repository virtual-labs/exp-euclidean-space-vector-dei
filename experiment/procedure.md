### Procedure

1. On the first page of simulation, first step is to choose a point on plane.
2. Observe the outcomes in the "Geometric Visualization" and "Vector Representation" boxes.
3. Read the given observations carefully.
4. Press “Next” to go to the next page for operations in 2-dimensional Euclidean space.
5. Choose the requisite tab for performing operations in 2-dimensional Euclidean space.
6. Enter values and press "Submit" button to get the result.
7. Observe the respective "Geometric Visualization" and "Vector Representation".
8. Press “Next” to go to the next page.
9. Choose tab to select the value of n, to understand the Euclidean space for different values on n.
10. Go through "Conclusion". Please don't skip this step.
