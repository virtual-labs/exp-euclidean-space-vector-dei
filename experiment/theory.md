### Theory

Let N and R denote the natural numbers and real numbers respectively.

1. Euclidean Space (2-dimensional)
The system ( R2 ,+ , . ) together with R is the 2-dimensional Euclidean space, where

i. R2 = { (x , y) | (x , y) ∈ R}
ii. + , called addition, is defined as
(a , b) + (c , d) = ( a+c , b+d ) where a, b, c, d ∈ R
iii. . , called scalar multiplication, is defined as
α . (a , b) = (α . a , α . b) where α is the scalar and a , b ∈ R .
Note that,
